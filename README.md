# Start the app

Use `npm start` to launch the website. No need to launch the backend, everything's deployed on render.

# Content of this repository

This repository is consisted of:
    -A react front-end
    -A strapi back-end (*my-project* folder)

The API has two main components: (tarot) cards and oracle. 'Cards' component doesn't allow CRUD: it's made for users to learn more about the original 78 tarot cards. 'Oracle' component allows every CRUD operations.

# Ressources

This project was made using React, Render, Axios, MUI, Strapi (and Prettier). 

# Side note on Render

Intially, I meant to deploy the app using PostgreSQL. I unfortunately didn't have enough time to learn properly about that method, so I deployed it the "easy" way. It may encounter some problems (lagging, elements lacking in the API, etc.). If any problem is encountered, you can always check the API using `cd my-project` then `npm start`
